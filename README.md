# SF Endorsement Matrix
Using information from [SFEndorsements.com](https://sfendorsements.com/) and inspired by [Sig.gy/sfendorsements](https://github.com/siggy/sfendorsements)

PRs welcome! I will try to keep this up-to-date with the SF Endorsements website, and will view that as the source of truth. I don't have time to add or vet additional endorsements beyond that!

Also, check out [OpenBallot](https://openballot.app/) if you want to create your own voter guide!
